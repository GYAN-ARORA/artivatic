The project is as follows:

- EDA_report.html is an interactive EDA report. I highly encourage you to keep it open in a browser window as you evaluate the project
- The final submission is in the file submission.csv
- The code is inside submission.ipynb
- The same notebook has been exported to html and formats, so that it can be conveniently viewed on any machine.
- I have removed the intermediate files created because they were large and inconvenient to upload to git.
- To view the html files, just double click on them and they will open up in a browser
